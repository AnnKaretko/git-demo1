sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on their choosen battle field


Form the lines
Shield by shield

'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
And I wanna feel you, too
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins
Just me and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love, tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
